\nüìç Location Integration ‚Äì Enabled customers to request a wash at their exact location (home, office, or elsewhere).

\nüí≥ Secure Payments ‚Äì Integrated in-app payment methods for safe and fast transactions.

\nüîî Real-time Notifications ‚Äì Added push notifications to keep users updated on booking status and promotions.

\nüìÖ Scheduling & History ‚Äì Built features for scheduling future washes and viewing service history.

\nüéÅ Loyalty & Promotions ‚Äì Developed reward and offer modules to increase customer engagement.

\nüë§ User Profile & Management ‚Äì Created user profile management including personal info, vehicle details, and preferences.`,
